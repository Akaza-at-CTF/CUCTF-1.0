# Flying Flags

> After WIZCON our Streamer changed her username on a chirping website and tried to hide any personal information but she still leaked something out.

On her Twitter page is an image with a plane ticket. Using an online barcode tool like [inlite](https://online-barcode-reader.inliteresearch.com/). It looks like a Pdf417 so select that one.

The flag is `CUCTF{D0_N0T_P05T_3V3RYTH1NG}`.
